## 🎯 Mini Projects

Apply what you've learned with small, real-world JavaScript projects:

| #  | Project                        | Folder Name             |
|----|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 01 | 🧮 Simple Calculator App        | `project-calculator`     |
| 02 | ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game           | `project-tic-tac-toe`    |

Each project includes:

- 📄 `index.html`
- 🎨 `style.css`
- ⚙️ `script.js`
- ✅ Simple, clean UI with interactive logic

> Projects are great for testing your DOM, event handling, logic, and UI skills!
